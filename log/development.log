I'm awkward, I can't think clearly or articulate my thoughts, and if it's really serious, I'll resort to the silent treatment. I can stand up for myself when it comes to it, but as a general rule I tend to avoid uncomfortable situations, and in my book any type of unpleasant interaction with another person qualifies as such. When I'm feeling attacked by someone, it's like my brain stops working, which is really unfortunate. I always come up with fantastic comebacks just as soon as it's over. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\r\n\r\nThis week DBC asks us to describe a time in our life that we've been in a conflict and elaborate on how we handled it. I'm not really comfortable airing my personal dirty laundry to internet strangers, so instead I'm going to focus on potential future conflicts and coming up with some strategies that I can implement to help me more effectively handle confrontation.\r\n\r\nPart of my problem is that I always aim to please. I'd usually prefer to be unhappy as opposed to making someone else unhappy. This is fine in moderation, in fact it's called being considerate. But always letting others have their way leads to pent up frustration, both because I'm feeling walked all over, and also because the other person isn't recognizing that I'm feeling that way. I can imagine this coming to fruition in a future pairing session, where we've implemented all my pair's ideas and I'm left feeling useless because I haven't contributed, and annoyed that my pair hasn't acknowledged that I'm being so considerate.\r\n\r\nIf I want to avoid this frustration, I need to vocalize my opinion early and often. Finding my voice is something that I really hope to accomplish at DBC. Not speaking up when something bothers me simply because I'm trying to avoid conflict inevitably leads to bigger confrontations, and I've seen that happen several times in my personal life.\r\n\r\nI am very passive when it comes to conflict.

I'm awkward, I can't think clearly or articulate my thoughts, and if it's really serious, I'll resort to the silent treatment. I can stand up for myself when it comes to it, but as a general rule I tend to avoid uncomfortable situations, and in my book any type of unpleasant interaction with another person qualifies as such. When I'm feeling attacked by someone, it's like my brain stops working, which is really unfortunate. I always come up with fantastic comebacks just as soon as it's over. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\r\n\r\nThis week DBC asks us to describe a time in our life that we've been in a conflict and elaborate on how we handled it. I'm not really comfortable airing my personal dirty laundry to internet strangers, so instead I'm going to focus on potential future conflicts and coming up with some strategies that I can implement to help me more effectively handle confrontation.\r\n\r\nPart of my problem is that I always aim to please. I'd usually prefer to be unhappy as opposed to making someone else unhappy. This is fine in moderation, in fact it's called being considerate. But always letting others have their way leads to pent up frustration, both because I'm feeling walked all over, and also because the other person isn't recognizing that I'm feeling that way. I can imagine this coming to fruition in a future pairing session, where we've implemented all my pair's ideas and I'm left feeling useless because I haven't contributed, and annoyed that my pair hasn't acknowledged that I'm being so considerate.\r\n\r\nIf I want to avoid this frustration, I need to vocalize my opinion early and often. Finding my voice is something that I really hope to accomplish at DBC. Not speaking up when something bothers me simply because I'm trying to avoid conflict inevitably leads to bigger confrontations, and I've seen that happen several times in my personal life.\r\n\r\nI am very passive when it comes to conflict.
